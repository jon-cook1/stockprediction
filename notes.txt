Notes:

Sean- Compare the approaches/ models. Just binary now but will evaluate the performance/ how it learns

Jon- Look into how to make a network that predicts magnitude. Get some code down and mention that it's the next step in the presentation

Haran- Research new indicators to incllude in model
